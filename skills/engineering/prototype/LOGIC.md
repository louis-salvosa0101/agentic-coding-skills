# Logic Prototype

A single, self-contained HTML file (a **shareable demo**) that lets anyone drive a state model by clicking buttons. Use this when the question is about **business logic, state transitions, or data shape**: the kind of thing that looks reasonable on paper but only feels wrong once you push it through real cases.

Because it's one file with nothing to install, you can hand it to a non-developer (a designer, a PM, a domain expert) and let them feel the model for themselves. So it speaks their language, not the code's.

## When this is the right shape

- "I'm not sure if this state machine handles the edge case where X then Y."
- "Does this data model actually let me represent the case where..."
- "I want to feel out what the API should look like before writing it."
- Anything where someone wants to **press buttons and watch state change**.

If the question is "what should this look like," this is the wrong branch. Use [UI.md](UI.md).

## Process

### 1. State the question

Before writing code, write down what state model and what question you're prototyping. One paragraph, at the top of the demo (in a visible intro, not just a comment). A logic prototype that answers the wrong question is pure waste, so make the question explicit so it can be checked later, whether the user is watching now or returning to it AFK.

### 2. Isolate the logic in a portable module

Put the actual logic (the bit that's answering the question) in a single `<script>` block written as a small, pure module that could be lifted out and dropped into the real codebase later. The page around it is throwaway; this module isn't.

The right shape depends on the question:

- **A pure reducer**: `(state, action) => state`. Good when actions are discrete events and state is a single value.
- **A state machine**: explicit states and transitions. Good when "which actions are even legal right now" is part of the question.
- **A small set of pure functions** over a plain data type. Good when there's no implicit current state, just transformations.
- **A class or module with a clear method surface** when the logic genuinely owns ongoing internal state.

Pick whichever shape best fits the question being asked, *not* whichever is easiest to wire to a page. Keep it pure: no DOM, no `document`, no button handlers reaching inside it. The page calls into it; nothing flows the other direction. This is what makes the prototype useful past its own lifetime: once the question's answered, the validated reducer / machine / function set lifts into the real module on its own.

### 3. Build the shareable HTML file

One file, plain HTML/CSS/JS: no framework, no bundler, no server, everything inline so it opens by double-click and survives being emailed around.

Structure:

1. **Header**: the question being answered, in plain language.
2. **Free-play panel**: current state displayed prominently, action buttons below it. Every legal action is a button; illegal actions are visibly disabled. Buttons fire the reducer/machine and re-render.
3. **Guided walkthroughs** (one tab per case): a sequence of pre-scripted steps that walks through a specific scenario, with a "Next step" button and a running commentary on what's happening and why. Cover the cases that are hard to reason about on paper.
4. **State inspector**: a collapsible raw JSON view of the current state, for debugging.

The UI is functional, not polished. Basic HTML, minimal CSS. The logic module is the point.

### 4. Document the decision

After the user has exercised the prototype, write a short decision record (1-3 paragraphs):

- What question was answered.
- What the answer is.
- What was ruled out.

This feeds into `/to-spec` or the grilling thread. The prototype file itself is then deleted or archived.
